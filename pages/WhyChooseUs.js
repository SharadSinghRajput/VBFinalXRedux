                <p>I would start with why Astrology seems to be losing its sheen in present times despite being the most ancient & authentic science. There are two reasons for it.</p>
                <p>It is not astrology as a science to be blamed, but people practicing astrology are to be blamed.</p>
                <p>Second, your own wisdom in selecting the right astrologer. Yes, I really mean it. </p>
                <p>I am an astrologer myself, so I probably am better positioned to explain it to you from a common man's understanding instead of using specific astrology words or phrases. Because once you know how to judge a good astrologer, you don't have to worry because then a good astrologer will take care of astrological facts him/herself. </p>
                <h2 className="py-4 justify-center text-2xl leading-6 text-black">Who can be a good astrologer?</h2>
                <p>Let us understand a few essential things about the method of Vedic astrology prediction. An astrologer who follows these basic principles of astrology can be a good astrologer. </p>
                <ol className="list-decimal px-16">
                    <li>
                        <p>The astrologer should know how to co-relate the present horoscope with your past life. We all know that a horoscope/birth chart is the direct manifesto of your past life(s) deeds. An astrologer who does not know how to co-relate this cannot be good.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The astrologer should know how to verify your accurate birth time before doing any analysis or giving predictions. Let me clarify here that even one minute error in the birth details can make complete analysis and predictions flawed. So a good astrologer should have the competence to cross-verify your accurate birth details. This should be done by telling you at least one thing about you before the astrologer actually starts any analysis & giving predictions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The astrologer should have some essential qualifications with a mathematics background. I mean the person should be astrologer by design and by default. A good astrologer is an outcome and a combination of intent, intuition, practical experience, and some essential qualifications. Practical experience at large is bragged, and no doubt helps, but in modern times, accuracy in mathematical calculation plays a great role.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A good astrologer should not scare you only with the negatives in the horoscope. Let me clarify here that each horoscope has both negative and positive planetary combinations. But nothing gives results be it negative or positive by itself. A good astrologer should advise you on how to keep the negative planets and combinations pacified and deactivated. And how to fructify positive ones. This is better done with more focus on karmic correction beforehand rather than when negative planets have impacted you or the time to reap benefits from positive ones has lapsed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Here comes the role of planetary transits. Let me tell you, even from the negative planets; one can get the best results in good transits and Dashas. Any astrologer who only talks about planetary combination which are fixed in the birth chart and ignores how to use transits to mould the results cannot be a good astrologer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A competent astrologer should not focus only on D-1, the Lagna Chart, for any in-depth analysis. Some astrologers adopt short cuts in giving solutions. Short cut means giving astrological solutions by only reading D-1 Chart, the Lagna Chart, rather than going deeper into the relevant divisional charts. Let us be clear there are specific divisional charts for each aspect of life. To explain it in a layman's language – the D-1 chart is like the Index of a book, and divisional charts are the actual & detailed descriptions of charts.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2 className="py-4 justify-center text-2xl leading-6 text-black">How can one find a good astrologer?</h2>
                <p>How to find a good astrologer to a large extent depends on your own wisdom and skills.</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal px-16">
                    <li>
                        <p>Apart from reading through websites and promotional campaigns, one should check on the following points to find a good astrologer. Do not go by "who is the top best astrologer," but check "who can be a good astrologer" based on specific parameters. What are these parameters to find a good astrologer? I am explaining below:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A good astrologer cannot be area-specific like the best Astrologer in India, Mumbai, Delhi & like that. A good astrologer will be good & the best astrologer will be the best irrespective of any geographical boundaries.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>One must check if the readings will be done by the astrologer him/herself rather than assigning the task to the juniors and Acharyas down the line.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>One must check if the astrologer has the required essential qualification and complete insight into Falit Jyotish. If need be, one should be frank to ask for a document to substantiate this.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The astrologer must have reasonable practical experience.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Check the 3rd party references about the astrologer apart from their own websites & channels.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Check what people talk about that astrologer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A normal person may not be able to check, but essential of a good astrologer is that s(he) must have a good association of Jupiter with the 2nd house or Lord of the 2nd house.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>These parameters will help a person to find a good astrologer.</p>
                <h2 className="py-4 justify-center text-2xl leading-6 text-black">How to make correct predictions in astrology?</h2>
                <p>I believe in the basic Indian Astrology, which says that the positioning of planets in any horoscope is the direct result of one's past life karmas ( Dridh Karmas); therefore, my analysis & advice emphasizes this. These Dridh Karmas are fixed as your past & future is not in your hand, so how can astrology help? That is where my methodology & expertise differs from many other top best astrologers.</p>
                <p>Astrology should focus on learning from the past karmas ( good or bad), implement required & force corrections in our present karmas ( ADRIDH Karmas). It will lay future path with certainty, Yes with certainty, instead of depending on uncertain astrological predictions loaded with astrological remedies. This is where Indian Vedic Astrology differs from Western Astrology, which reads the present & future only. My perception of Astrology is to deal with it in a Karmic way & not a ritualistic way.</p>
                <p><strong>Birth time accuracy</strong></p>
                <p>I start with the basic rule of Vedic astrology: accurate birth time. Many people come with their birth time & date. But I find a large percentage of them have a difference in birth time of a few minutes. During the consultation, my first focus is to ensure that the birth details are 100% accurate without even an iota of doubts. Because it not only plays foul with the native but err my predictions, and I get a bad reference</p>
                <p>Birth time accuracy is essential for casting any astrological birth chart & for giving accurate astrological predictions & guidance. For readings only from D- 1 or Lagna chart, sometimes even an error of 2 hours may not matter, but for many charts, e.g. D – 60 Chart where the ascendant changes every minute, it is mandatory to be 100% sure of birth time accuracy.</p>
                <p>In case of any confusion or even people who do not have their exact birth time, many do not even know the date & Year of birth; Here, it is better do not take astrology predictions till the time your correct birth details are synchronized.</p>
                <p>People who are sure of their birth time but still facing issues in mainly career & business may have an error in their birth time, so they should consider getting their birth time rectification. You can read more about <strong>how birth time rectification is done on the link given below.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Pre-analysis of birth chart for Karma Correction</strong></p>
                <p>I firmly believe that Destiny is Pre-defined, which even the Creator (Brahma) cannot change. So I prefer knowing birth details before the consultation to peep deep into the relevant D Charts & gathering clear perception of native's Dridh Karmas & try to balance out the same through the Adridh Karmas (of the present life) & these readings (called Karma Correction.) This Karma Correction is an essential tool where I try to balance out your Jupiter, which, if operating lower, can give you dismayed hopes, unrealistic desires, the highest level of optimism, etc. I try & guide you on how to balance out it to operate at optimum or higher levels.</p>
                <p><strong>Past life readings</strong></p>
                <p>Pre-analysis of birth charts with accurate birth details helps me determine the co-relation of a person's planetary position and past life deeds, as explained above. So in a way, in all consultation, I refer to a person's past life automatically. Very few astrologers do it, but I do not proceed without it. Many people even go for a past life reading. The concept of past life reading is more popular with my clients of Western Countries.</p>
                <p>My expertise in giving astrology advice on human problems is explained in different segments of my website.</p>

                <p>You generally know planetary combinations for the delay in marriage. But I also focus on human reasons for causing a delay in marriage.

                <p>I check overall compatibility factors in marriage than only believing in Gun Milan. People say 18 Gun matching is suitable for wedding, but I say less than 18 gun matching is no criterion for not marrying, and 32 or 34 Gun Milan is no guarantee for a successful marriage. The significance of marriage compatibility factors has increased over time due to uplifting female's status in society than from the male -dominating community. This holds good, especially in India.

                <p>Let me tell you, over 50% of people who come to me thinking that they are Manglik are not Manglik at all.

                <p>One business cannot be good for all. Else in a particular new business, new startups would reach the heights, and many settled businesses close.

                <p>On the court cases, my first focus is to evaluate whether it is advisable also to fight the court case or settlement is better.

                <p>Same way, I tell people how to avoid alcoholism at the initial stage of symptoms than performing <a href="https://www.vinaybajrangi.com/health-astrology/drug-addiction.php" target="_blank"><strong>rituals to overcome alcoholism</strong></a>. Alcoholism is an addiction out of our karmas, so better diagnose the astrological reasons for alcoholism, get rid of those reasons, than performing rituals.</p>
                <p>The same way my expertise on all astrological predictions is to peep deep into your past life deeds, the impact of past life deeds on your birth chart and present life, how to modify your karmas. Of course, if to get rid of any accumulated effects, some <a href="https://www.vinaybajrangi.com/astrology-remedies.php" target="_blank"><strong>astrology remedies</strong></a> are required, I do recommend it. But here also, my perception is that astrology remedies will not help without the element of Karma Correction. You may listen to my Video on <a href="https://youtu.be/MYvmyBlEbY0"><strong>Karma Correction</strong></a>.</p>
                <p><strong>The Conscience of the native before meeting the astrologer</strong></p>
                <p>The day the native chooses to meet the astrologer personally, or through other means like telephone or Skype, the following things are essentially required of him:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc px-8">
                    <li>The native should go to the astrologer with a clean and unbiased mind.</li>
                    <li>The intention of the native should not be to test the astrologer. But should be to seek a spiritual solution for his problem.</li>
                    <li>He /She should pray to the Lord Ganesha and Kul Devta on the day when the consultation happens.</li>
                    <li>He /She should offer some fruits and fresh flowers to God while praying.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The reading from the astrologer should not be for free. A free reading further indebts the native and ruins his karma—an empty-handed native to an astrologer return empty-handed.</p>
                <p><strong>Protocol for meeting with an Astrologer</strong></p>
                <p>Before reaching the astrologer, the native should follow some simple rules, i.e.:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>He should prepare a list of questions which one has to ask.</li>
                    <li>One should not the same question in different ways to get a favorable answer from the astrologer. One should know that the first answer offered by the astrologer is the Bhram Vakya.</li>
                    <li>Jyothisha is one of the six components of Vedang. The other five elements are Shiksha, Kalp, Nirukt, Chhand, and Vyakaran. Jyotish Shastra is further subdivided into Ganit, Samhita, and Hora. These all are related to Complex mathematical analysis with a put of divinity. It is therefore very essential that the intentions of the native should be apparent and pious.</li>
                    <li>It is seen that to test the astrologers, sometimes the native pose false questions. If a native habitually raises wrong questions, then the native has paved ways to sink in the muddle that too without any respite.</li>
                    <li>The time should be the essence; wasting time by asking the same question over and over again is a bad omen.</li>
                    <li>Asking questions for others than the specific horoscope is again like indebting without consent. One should avoid this behavior and temptation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Final take on essential qualities of an astrologer</strong></p>
                <p>Every rules book classifies the relationship between a client/follower & the individual in the subject. As it applies to all the professionals, the same way, it applies to the querist and the astrologer. It is indeed a Guru- Shishya relationship with a pious bounding. Suppose this relationship adheres to the basic essential qualities of an astrologer and the protocol of the natives. Then I am sure the things take a trustworthy shape. And both will cherish a healthy bond.</p>
